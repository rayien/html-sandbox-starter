      TOKYO : Some Bank of Japan board members called for the need to keep
      raising interest rates with one saying they should eventually be increased
      to at least around 1 per cent, a summary of opinions voiced at the bank's
      July policy meeting showed on Thursday. At the July 30-31 meeting, the BOJ
      raised its short-term policy target to 0.25 per cent from a range of 0 per
      cent to 0.1 per cent and released a detailed plan on how to taper its huge
      asset buying in another landmark shift away from a decade-long stimulus
      programme. Some in the nine-member board said inflation-adjusted real
      interest rates will remain very low even after the rate hike, which meant
      the BOJ would continue to support the economy with loose monetary policy,
      the summary showed. "The BOJ must proceed with further adjustment of the
      degree of monetary accommodation as appropriate" even after hiking rates
      in July if companies continue to raise prices, wages and ramp up capital
      expenditure, one member was quoted as saying.
