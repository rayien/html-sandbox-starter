        SINGAPORE - The Workersâ€™ Party (WP) and Progress Singapore Party (PSP)
        said they welcomed moves to provide monetary support to workers who have
        lost their jobs, and to help parents under the new shared parental leave
        initiative. At the same time, the two opposition parties urged the
        Government to make deeper policy reforms, particularly in the provision
        of public housing. In his maiden National Day Rally speech on Aug 18,
        Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced the SkillsFuture Jobseeker
        Support scheme, under which unemployed individuals can receive temporary
        financial support of up to $6,000 over up to six months, subject to
        training, job coaching and other conditions.
