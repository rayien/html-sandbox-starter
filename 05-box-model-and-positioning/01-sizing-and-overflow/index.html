        SINGAPORE – Noise sensors might soon be deployed in homes as part of
        efforts to resolve severe noise disputes between neighbours, if
        legislative changes to laws governing community disputes are tabled in
        Parliament and passed. The use of these sensors is part of a suite of
        amendments to the Community Disputes Resolution Act that the Ministry of
        Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) hopes to table in Parliament by the
        end of 2024.
